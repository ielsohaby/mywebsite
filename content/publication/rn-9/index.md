abstract: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2014 to December 2015 to determine seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with *Toxoplasma gondii* (*T. gondii*) infection in domestic rabbits and humans in Egypt. In total 290 blood samples were collected from humans (n = 140) and slaughtered rabbits (n = 150) and were analyzed using ELISA for *T. gondii* IgM and IgG antibodies. *T. gondii* IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in, respectively, 9 (6%) and 40 (26.7%) of 150 rabbits raised in Cairo, Qalyubia, and Sharkia Governorates, Egypt. Corresponding overall seroprevalences for human participants were 5.7% and 35.7%, respectively. Rabbit age, management (farm, backyard and pet shop) and the presence of cats at rabbit raising areas were significantly associated with the seroprevalence of *T. gondii* IgG antibodies. *T. gondii* IgG antibodies seropositivity in pregnant participants and rabbit butchers were 0.17 and 0.63 times lower than immunocompromised participants, respectively. However, participants who consumed undercooked rabbit meat was 7.59 times higher than participants who consumed meat from other sources. The results indicate that domestic rabbits are a potential source of *T. gondii* infections in human in Egypt. Thus, dissemination of protective measures is essential, especially for rabbit butchers and immunocompromised individuals.
