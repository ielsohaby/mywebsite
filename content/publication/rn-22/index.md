abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors associated with *Chlamydia psittaci* infections in psittacine birds and bird handlers in Egypt. A total of 190 swabs were collected from psittacine birds (n = 120) and bird handlers (n = 70) and were tested by polymerase chain reaction to detect the *C. psittaci ompA* gene. *Chlamydia psittaci* DNA was detected in 63 (52·5%) of 120 samples collected from psittacine birds. The occurrence of *C. psittaci* infections was high in Cockatiel birds (60%), followed by Fischer's lovebird (51%) and Rosy-faced lovebird (47·5%). Bird age, location (pet markets and households), housing (caged and aviary), and sampling season were considered significant risk factors for *C. psittaci* infections in psittacine birds. Of the 70 sputum swabs collected from bird handlers, only 4 (6%) were positive for C. psittaci. Positive cases were closely associated with older persons (≥30 years) who had respiratory signs and handled birds in pet markets. Further, wearing protective gloves and washing hands when handling psittacine birds decreased the frequency of *C. psittaci* infections in bird handlers. The prevalence of *C. psittaci* infections in psittacine birds in Egypt is high, which has a potential threat to human health in this area. Thus, dissemination of effective prevention and control measures is essential to prevent the spread of *C. psittaci* among psittacine birds, as well as among humans in contact with birds. Results from this study highlighted the risk factors associated with *C. psittaci* infections in psittacine birds and bird handlers in Egypt and will aid in developing prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of *C. psittaci* infection."
