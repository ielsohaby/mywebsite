abstract: Bacterial pathogens carried by pet birds are considered a risk for birds, workers, and pet owners. This study investigated the potential of pet birds as reservoirs for virulent multidrug-resistant (MDR) zoonotic bacteria and assessed the genetic relatedness and diversity of bacterial isolates from pet birds and human contacts. Cloacal and tracheal swabs from 125 pet birds and 70 hand swabs from human contacts were collected. The results revealed that the pet birds were reservoirs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.6 %, each), and Staphylococcus aureus (15.2 %). These isolates were also identified in their human contacts, at percentages of 14.3 %, 12.9 %, and 24.3 %, respectively. Virulence associated genes were identified from E. coli (stx2, stx2f, eaeA, and hlyA), K. pneumoniae (fimH, TraT, and magA), and S. aureus (PVL, hly, sea, sed genes) isolates. Multidrug-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus were highly prevalent (81.3 %, 90.3 %, and 61.1 %, respectively). The genetic relationship between the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from the pet birds and human contacts were determined by ERIC-PCR, while, RAPD-PCR was used for the S. aureus isolates. ERIC-PCR was found to have the highest discriminatory power. The clustering of the isolates from the pet birds and human contacts indicated potential transmission between the birds and workers. In conclusion, pet birds could act as potential reservoirs for zoonotic bacterial pathogens; thus, posing a risk to their human contacts.
