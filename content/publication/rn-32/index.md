abstract: The microbiological quality of colostrum and identify cow, calf and farm managemental factors associated with colostrum hygiene in Colombian dairy herds were determined. Colostrum samples (n = 255) from 44 herds were collected for bacteriological quality analysis. A survey about colostrum management was carried out for each birth event. Only 18% of the samples exceeded the threshold 100,000 cfu mL−1 for the total bacterial count (TBC), and more than 54.5% of the herds have at least one colostrum sample above the TBC threshold. The total coliform count was higher than the threshold 10,000 cfu mL−1 in 24.3% of colostrum samples and 68.2% of herds. Associations between cow-calf factors and the colostrum hygiene were examined. The two-level logistic regression showed that the colostrum microbiological quality was influenced by suckling colostrum from mother, feeding colostrum with a bottle and when the colostrum came of large herds.
