abstract: Refractometry is used to assess transfer of passive immunity (TPI), but studies evaluating different refractometers and appropriate thresholds for recommended target immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations for beef calves are limited. To evaluate test performance of digital (DSTP) and optical (OSTP) serum total protein (STP) refractometers and a digital Brix (DBRIX) refractometer for assessment of passive immunity in beef calves. A total of 398 beef calves from 6 herds, 1 to 7 days of age. Serum IgG concentration was estimated by DSTP, OSTP, and DBRIX, and measured by radial immunodiffusion (RID). Correlation coefficients (*r*) among results were calculated. Optimal STP and Brix thresholds for identification of IgG <10, <16, and <24 g/L were determined using interval likelihood ratios. Refractometer performance and agreement were assessed using areas under the curve (AUC), diagnostic test characteristics, Cohen's kappa (*κ*), and Bland-Altman analysis. Refractometer results were highly correlated with RID (*r* = 0.82-0.91) and with each other (*r* = 0.91-0.95), and overall test performance was excellent (AUC = 0.93-0.99). The STP concentrations of ≤5.1, ≤5.1, and ≤5.7 g/dL and Brix percentages of ≤7.9%, ≤8.3%, and ≤8.7% indicated IgG concentrations <10, <16, and <24 g/L, respectively. Agreement of refractometers with RID was variable (*κ* = 0.46-0.80) and among refractometers was substantial (*κ* = 0.62-0.89). All refractometers showed good utility as monitoring tools for assessment of TPI in beef calves.
