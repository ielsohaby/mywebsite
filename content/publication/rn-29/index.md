abstract: "Antimicrobial resistance profile of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* serovars isolated from diarrheic calves and handlers in Egypt is unknown due to the absence of monitoring. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the virulence, genetic and antimicrobial resistance profiles of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* serovars associated with diarrhea in calves and handlers in intensive dairy farms in Egypt. A total of 36 bacterial strains (20 *E. coli* and 16 *Salmonella*) were isolated from fecal samples of 80 diarrheic Holstein dairy calves (10 *E. coli* and 13 *Salmonella*) and hand swabs of 35 handlers (10 *E. coli* and 3 *Salmonella*) in two intensive dairy farms in Sharkia Governate in Egypt. *E. coli* strains belonged to six different serogroups and O114:K90 was the most prevalent serogroup (30%). However, *Salmonella* strains were serotyped into four different serogroups and *S. Kiel* was the most prevalent serotype (50%). Thirteen (65%) *E. coli* isolates were harbouring either *stx2*, *eaeA* and/or *astA* virulence-associated genes. However, *stn* and *spvC* virulence genes were detected in 2 (12.5%) and 4 (25%) of *Salmonella* isolates, respectively. *E. coli* isolates showed marked resistance to ampicillin (75%), while *Salmonella* strains exhibited high resistance to amikacin (100%), gentamicin (93.75%) and tobramycin (87.5%). Results of the present study showed that *E. coli* and *Salmonella* serovars isolated from diarrheic calves and handlers in intensive dairy farms in Egypt exhibited resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials, which may pose a public health hazard. Thus, the continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is necessary for both humans and veterinary medicine to decrease the economic losses caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains in animals as well as the zoonotic risk."
