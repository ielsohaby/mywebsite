abstract: Brix refractometry can be used to assess colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, but studies identifying Brix percentages to detect high- and low-IgG colostrum are lacking for beef cows and interlaboratory agreement is unknown. Evaluate Brix refractometer performance and interlaboratory agreement for assessing beef cow colostrum IgG concentration, including determination of thresholds to identify colostrum containing IgG concentrations <100 g/L and ≥150 g/L. Beef cows (n = 416) from 11 cow-calf operations in Alberta, Canada. Colostral IgG concentrations were measured using radial immunodiffusion (RID) and estimated by Brix refractometry for this retrospective study. Spearman correlation coefficients were assessed between RID and Brix refractometry. Likelihood ratios and misclassification cost-term analysis were used to determine optimal Brix percentages for detecting colostrum containing IgG concentrations <100 g/L and ≥150 g/L. Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman analyses were performed for Brix percentages obtained at 3 different laboratories. Brix percentages obtained at 3 laboratories were positively correlated with IgG results (*r* = 0.72, 0.68, and 0.76, respectively). Colostrum Brix percentages of <24% and ≥30% were optimal for indicating IgG concentrations of <100 g/L and ≥150 g/L, respectively. Interlaboratory agreement was substantial, with CCC ranging from 0.89 to 0.96 and Bland-Altman analysis showing small mean differences (−1.2% to 0.09% Brix) and narrow limits of agreements (−4.8% to 2.4% Brix) among laboratories. Brix refractometry shows good potential for reliably estimating IgG concentrations in beef cow colostrum across multiple laboratories and can be recommended to aid colostrum management decisions on farms.
