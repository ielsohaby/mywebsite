abstract: "Several species of Vibrio were identified in 4% of total examined samples with the highest isolation in human stool samples. *Vibrio cholerae* (*V. cholerae*) was highly isolated in raw milk (66.7%), whereas *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* (*V. parahaemolyticus*) was highly isolated in yoghurt (75%) out of the positive samples. The tested cholera toxin (*ctxAB*), haemolysin toxin (*hlyA*) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (*tcpA*) associated-virulence genes were identified in all *V. cholera* isolates. However, the thermostable direct haemolysin (*tdh*) and the thermostable direct haemolysin-related haemolysin (*trh*) associated-virulence genes were identified in 33.3% and 16.7% of the examined *V. parahaemolyticus* isolates, respectively. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index ranged from 0.15 to 0.54. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus polymerase chain reaction showed a higher respective discriminatory power to *V. cholerae* and *V. parahaemolyticus* (D = 0.93 and D = 1, respectively) isolates. *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* (*L. rhamnosus*) probiotic activity on *V. cholerae* and *V. parahaemolyticus* can eliminate or significantly reduce the number of bacteria. In conclusion, most *V. cholerae* and *V. parahaemolyticus* isolates exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes. However, tetracycline, trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and meropenem were recommended to treat vibriosis. *L. rhamnosus* could be used as an effective and applicable method for controlling antimicrobial-resistant *Vibrio* isolates."
