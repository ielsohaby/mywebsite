abstract: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of the transmission infrared (IR) spectroscopic method and digital and optical Brix refractometers for measurement of colostral IgG concentration and assessment of colostrum quality of dairy cows. Colostrum samples (n = 258) were collected from Holstein cows on 30 commercial dairy farms in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Canada. Colostral IgG concentrations of 255 samples were measured by the reference radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay and IR spectroscopy. The Brix scores were determined on 240 of these samples using both the digital and optical Brix refractometers. Approximately half (48%) of the colostrum samples had RID IgG concentrations <50 g/L, which was the cut-point for poor quality. The correlation between RID and IR IgG concentrations was 0.88. The correlations between RID IgG concentration and Brix scores, as determined by the digital and optical refractometers, were 0.72 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cutoff levels for distinguishing good- and poor-quality colostrum using IR spectroscopy, and digital and optical Brix refractometers were at 35 g/L and 23% Brix, respectively. The IR spectroscopy showed higher sensitivity (90%) and specificity (86%) than the digital (74 and 80%, respectively) and optical (73 and 80%, respectively) Brix refractometers for assessment of colostrum quality, as compared with RID. In conclusion, the transmission-IR spectroscopy is a rapid and accurate method for assessing colostrum quality, but is a laboratory-based method, whereas Brix refractometers were less accurate but could be used on-farm.
