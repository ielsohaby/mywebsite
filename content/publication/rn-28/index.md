abstract: "Acute phase proteins (APPs) and oxidative stress are helpful markers in diagnosis of several infectious diseases. APPs, proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were evaluated for their role in the diagnosis of naturally acquired *Coxiella burnetii* (Q fever) associated with abortion in sheep, goats and she-camels. Blood, aborted materials and vaginal swabs were collected from mixed herds in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Antioxidant biomarkers showed significant decline in cases of abortion compared to control animals at delivery time. The correlation between disease status and all parameters ranged from moderate to high. The APPs, cytokines and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) displayed a high degree of distinction between aborted sheep and goat and normal delivered animals (AUC > 0.90). However, only MDA showed a high degree of differentiation (AUC > 0.90) between aborted she-camels and normal delivered controls. In conclusion, results from our study allow us to recommend using APPs, cytokines and oxidative stress markers as an additional tool for diagnosis of naturally occurring *C. burnetii* infection in sheep, goats and she-camels. However, it does not replace standard procedures for detection of *C. burnetii*."
