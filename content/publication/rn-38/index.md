abstract: "Acute-phase proteins (APPs) have always had valued diagnostic potentialities in response to infection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of selected APPs and proinflammatory cytokines (PIC) in goats with contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) under field conditions. Moreover, to highlight the role of tested biomarkers in CCPP pathogenesis. Fifty-eight goats (38 confirmed cases with CCPP and 20 healthy controls) were involved in this investigation. C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), haptoglobin (HP), fibrinogen (Fb), serum amyloid A (SAA), selected PIC (IL1-α, IL1-β, IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) levels were investigated in serum samples from all goats under investigation. Latex agglutination test was used for diagnosis of goats with CCPP. For microbiological investigations, nasopharyngeal swabs (from all goats), lung tissues and pleural fluids (from only necropsied goats) were collected. This study revealed that all tested parameters have a high to moderate degree of diagnostic performance for CCPP. Magnitudes of increase in levels of APPs (CRP, HP and SAA) were stronger than PIC, IFN-γ, Fb and PCT. All tested parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy (AUROC >90%), except HP (AUROC = 87.3%) and IFN-γ (AUROC = 78.8%) showed moderate accuracy in differentiation of goats with and without CCPP infection. For detecting goats with and without CCPP infection, HP had the lowest sensitivity (Se = 81.6%) and Fb had the lowest specificity (Sp = 85.0%) among the APPs parameters tested. However, PCT showed the highest Se (100%) and Sp (95.0%) to detect goats with and without CCPP infection among tested parameters. Conclusively, this study endorses the significance of selected APPs and PIC as additional screening diagnostic parameters for naturally occurring CCPP in goats. However, it does not replace traditional methods for diagnosis of CCPP in goats. Furthermore, APPs and PIC have an important role in disease pathogenesis in goats."
