abstract: Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is a simple, rapid and cost-effective method for the analysis of serum. However, the complex nature of serum remains a limiting factor to the reliability of this method. We investigated the benefits of coupling the centrifugal ultrafiltration with ATR-IR spectroscopy for quantification of human serum IgA concentration. Human serum samples (n = 196) were analyzed for IgA using an immunoturbidimetric assay. ATR-IR spectra were acquired for whole serum samples and for the retentate (residue) reconstituted with saline following 300 kDa centrifugal ultrafiltration. IR-based analytical methods were developed for each of the two spectroscopic datasets, and the accuracy of each of the two methods compared. Analytical methods were based upon partial least squares regression (PLSR) calibration models - one with 5-PLS factors (for whole serum) and the second with 9-PLS factors (for the reconstituted retentate). Comparison of the two sets of IR-based analytical results to reference IgA values revealed improvements in the Pearson correlation coefficient (from 0.66 to 0.76), and the root mean squared error of prediction in IR-based IgA concentrations (from 102 to 79 mg/dL) for the ultrafiltration retentate-based method as compared to the method built upon whole serum spectra. Depleting human serum low molecular weight proteins using a 300 kDa centrifugal filter thus enhances the accuracy IgA quantification by ATR-IR spectroscopy. Further evaluation and optimization of this general approach may ultimately lead to routine analysis of a range of high molecular-weight analytical targets that are otherwise unsuitable for IR-based analysis.
