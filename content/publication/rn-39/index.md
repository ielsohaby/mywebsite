abstract: Clostridium difficile (CD) is considered a major health care problem both in developing and developed countries; frequently reported to be associated with enterocolitis and diarrhea in horses and other animals. In this study, we examined acute phase response (APR), cytokines response, neopterin (NP) procalcitonin (PCT) production and oxidative stress condition in horses and foals with C. difficile-induced enterocolitis (CDIE) and evaluated the effectiveness of these parameters as biomarkers for the disease. A total of 407 Arabian horses in 35 stables were examined between January 2017 to December 2018. Only 24 out of 407 horses showed two or more signs of CDIE. The blood level of serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (HP), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL1-β), serum malondialdehyde (MDA), PCT and NPT in horses with CDIE were higher than in healthy horses. Nevertheless, the levels of nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant concentration (TAC) were considerably lower in diseased horses compared to those that were healthy. The ROC curves for eleven selected blood parameters, both in healthy horses and horses with CDIE demonstrated that all examined blood markers had significant levels of differentiation between CDIE cases and healthy controls (AUC > 87.5). The data in this study suggest that the evaluation of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, PCT, NPT, and oxidative stress biomarkers may well be used as a tool for diagnosis and assessment of CDIE and in disease pathogenesis in Arabian horses.
