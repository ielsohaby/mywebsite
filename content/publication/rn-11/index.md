abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the digital Brix and optical serum total protein (STP) refractometers for measuring concentrations of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in alpacas and compare them to IgG concentrations measured by the reference method of radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay. The appropriate cutoff point for Brix and STP refractometers and the transmission infrared (TIR) spectroscopy method was determined for low IgG concentrations (< 10 g/L). Serum samples were collected from alpacas (N = 169) and tested by both refractometers. The correlation between Brix % and STP was high [correlation coefficient (*r*) = 0.99]. However, the correlation coefficients between Brix % and STP with serum RID-IgG concentrations were only 0.56 and 0.55, respectively. Twenty-one (12.4%) of 169 alpaca serum samples had IgG concentrations of < 10 g/L. Using receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, the optimal cutoff points for the TIR assay, digital Brix, and optical STP refractometers for assessing low IgG (RID < 10 g/L) were 13 g/L, 8.8%, and 50 g/L, respectively. The TIR assay showed higher sensitivity (Se = 95.2%) and specificity (Sp = 96.8%) than either the digital Brix (Se = 90.5% and Sp = 65.5%) or optical STP (Se = 81% and Sp = 73.7%) refractometers for assessing alpacas with low IgG. In conclusion, the Brix and STP refractometers lack accuracy in measuring alpaca IgG concentrations, but may be useful for screening animals for low serum IgG. However, the TIR assay with a cutoff point of 13 g/L was more appropriate for identifying low IgG than either refractometer. Another study that focuses on neonatal crias is recommended in order to evaluate the usefulness of these assays for field diagnosing of failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI).
