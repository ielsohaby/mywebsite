abstract: In this single herd observational study, there is investigation of the effects of 81 sires (with 11,424 artificial inseminations) on conception rates in 1790 Holstein cows for 5 years. Sires were catagorized based on the published sire conception rate (SCR) into different sire fertility groups (low, average and high fertility sires). The performance of different-sire fertility groups was assessed in timed artificial insemination (TAI) and repeat-breeder (RB) cows. With this aim, two logistic regression models with sire, inseminator, cow, and lactation random effects were applied to data on pregnancies assessed at days 30 and 70 post-insemination. Fixed effects of sire fertility group, sire breed, cow-fertility status, insemination type, postpartum problems, milk yield, temperature humidity index, and year were evaluated. Results from the analysis indicated there was a significant individual sire effect on conception rates, and large heterogeneity in values for this variable among sires. Results indicate that SCR could be assessed to predict low fertility sires reasonably well, and the predicted probabilities for pregnancy per AI (P/AI) at 30 and 70 days post-insemination for high fertility sires were consistent for the most part with values for the SCR. The sire breed did not affect conception rates at days 30 and 70 post-insemination nor its interactions with insemination type (estrous detection AI (EDAI) compared with TAI) and cow-fertility status (RB compared with non-RB). Predicting response probabilities for sires with at least 100 inseminations in each insemination group resulted in greater conception probabilities in cows in which there was EDAI than those in the TAI group.
